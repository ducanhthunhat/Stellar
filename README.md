Project Description: This project is a Payroll dApp built on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. It aims to simplify payroll administration for small retail businesses. The dApp allows business owners (Admins) to manage employee wallet addresses and salaries (in USDC tokens) directly on the blockchain. Admins can securely add/update salaries and trigger a bulk payment function. The smart contract then automatically distributes the correct USDC amount from the contract's fund to each employee's wallet, ensuring transparent, efficient, and automated payroll processing.

Vision: ✨ Our vision is to empower small retail businesses by leveraging blockchain technology for administrative efficiency. This Payroll dApp will significantly reduce the time and complexity of traditional payroll, minimizing errors and increasing transparency. By automating salary payments with USDC on the secure Stellar network, we aim to provide retailers with a cost-effective, reliable, and modern financial tool, allowing them to focus on growth and customer service in an increasingly digital world.
